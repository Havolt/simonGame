# simonGame

This was created as a projects in completing my freeCodeCamp course. It is a digital recreation of a toy in which the user must press buttons in the order they appear. The game gets faster as the user presses more and more correct sequences. 

Once the user has inputed 20 correct sequences in a row they will win the game and a brief animation will be displayed before the game is turned back off. The user can press the reset button at any time to start the game over.

A 'strict mode' switch has been implemented into the game which does not allow the user to retry but instead starts the game over from the very first sequence.

Sound effects were added to increase user feedback and create an overall better experience
